# bcompathon-discbot

A Discord Bot made at University of Guelph's Bachelor of Computing "BCOMPATHON" 2021. Placed as **Honourable Mention**. 

### Use 
- This bot is a pomodoro study timer that keeps track of the users study sessions
- The prefix is `+pomo `
### Arguments: 
- `+pomo ` [`25`/`short`]
  - 25 minute study session with 5 minute rest
- `+pomo ` [`50`/ `long`]
- `+pomo help` [command (optional)]
  - Gives list of all comands and;
- `+pomo help [command name]` to get info on a specific command

### Resources
- This bot was created thanks to [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/), previously the [Replit Database](https://docs.replit.com/misc/database), and now [Sequelize API V6](https://sequelize.org/)

### Afterwards
- At the moment, the bot is currently being maintained by the current authors and is looking to be improved for future purposes regarding studying in discord sessions.
- (05/10/2021) I'm actually currently planning on hosting the back-end using Google Firestore and host the actual bot using one of Google's services (also adding buttons!).
